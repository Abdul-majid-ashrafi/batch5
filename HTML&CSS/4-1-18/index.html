            The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate
            opacity. This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50%
            opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied (not child
            elements).

            CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
            The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
